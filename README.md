# Rails Lite

This project was built as a learning exercise to gain a greater understanding of the inner workings of Ruby on Rails. It implements several core features of Rails 3.2:

- RESTful routing
    - URI parameter parsing 
- Session handling
    - CSRF Authenticity Token generation and handling
- ControllerBase Object
    - Action definition and invocation 
    - Redirection support (```redirect_to```)
    - ERB template rendering
- Automatic URL helper generation (e.g.: ```get_users_path```)

This project is an expansion of [active-record-lite](http://github.com/wvandaal/active-record-lite), a similar project I built to explore the inner workings of ActiveRecord in Rails 3.2.
